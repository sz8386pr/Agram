Agram Rules

THE PACK
The kings, queens, jacks, the 2s of all suits and the ace of spades are removed from the deck. The cards of each suit rank,
from high to low: A, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3. Because the ace of spades (called "Chief"') is removed from the deck,
the highest card in the spade suit is the 10.

THE DEAL
The dealer will deal six cards to each player, three at a time.

THE PLAY
The player to the left of the dealer leads with a card of their choice. The next player to the left then follows with their card.
If possible they must follow suit. However, if they cannot, they may play a card of any suit.
If the card played does not belong to the original suit, it has no value. After all players have played their card,
the player who has the highest card of the original suit (suit of the leading card of the round) wins the trick.

The winner of the trick leads any card from his hand to begin the next trick, playing it face up on top of the pile.
Once again, the other players must each play a card of the same suit as the card that was led, if possible.
Otherwise they may play any card.

This continues until six tricks have been played. Whoever wins the sixth and last trick wins the game.
